## SAFFRON GROWTH CYCLE:
Planting (Late Spring to Early Summer)
•	Corms: Saffron is grown from corms (similar to bulbs), which are planted in late spring or early summer.
•	Soil: The soil needs to be well-drained and rich in organic matter, with a slightly alkaline pH.
2. Dormancy (Summer)
•	Rest Period: After planting, the corms enter a dormant phase during the hot summer months. During this time, there is little to no growth above ground.
3. Germination (Late Summer to Early Fall)
•	Roots and Shoots: As temperatures cool down in late summer, the corms begin to develop roots, and green shoots start to appear above the soil surface.
•	Irrigation: This is the time when the first irrigation is usually applied to help break dormancy and encourage growth.
4. Flowering (Mid to Late Fall)
•	Bloom: Saffron flowers bloom in mid to late fall, typically from October to November. The flowers have vivid purple petals and three red stigmas, which are the saffron threads.
•	Harvest: The flowers need to be hand-harvested early in the morning to ensure the best quality. The saffron threads are then carefully separated from the flowers and dried.
5. Vegetative Growth (Late Fall to Early Spring)
•	Leaf Growth: After flowering, the plant continues to grow leaves throughout the winter. The leaves help to store energy in the corms for the next growing season.
6. Corm Multiplication (Spring)
•	New Corms: By late winter to early spring, the corms begin to produce offsets or daughter corms, which will be used for future planting.
•	Withering: As the weather warms up, the leaves wither and the plant enters dormancy again, completing the cycle.
7. Harvest of Corms (Late Spring to Early Summer)
•	Corm Lifting: If needed, corms can be dug up, divided, and replanted in a different location to renew the crop.
## USAGE OF PELTIER MODULE: 
•	Cooling/Temperature Control for plant environment

•	For condensation/Dehumidification


## USE OF VAPORIZER:
1.	To optimize the humidity level
2.	For nutrient passing into the roots.
Temperature requirement for saffron:
Dormancy (Summer)
•	High Temperatures: Saffron corms can tolerate high temperatures during their dormant phase, typically around 35-40°C (95-104°F). 
Germination (Late Summer to Early Fall)
•	Cooling Down: As the summer heat subsides, temperatures between 15-25°C (59-77°F) are ideal for the corms to start germinating. 
Flowering (Mid to Late Fall)
•	Cool Temperatures: Saffron flowers best when temperatures range from 15-20°C (59-68°F).
Vegetative Growth (Late Fall to Early Spring)
•	Mild Winter: During the winter months, when the plant is in its vegetative growth stage, temperatures between 10-15°C (50-59°F)
Corm Multiplication (Spring)
Warming Up: As temperatures rise in spring, around 15-20°C (59-68°F) is ideal for corm multiplication.
 Humidity Requirement for Saffron growth:
Dormancy (Summer)
•	Low Humidity: During the summer dormancy period, saffron corms prefer low humidity levels.
Germination (Late Summer to Early Fall)
•	Moderate Humidity: As the corms break dormancy and begin to germinate, moderate humidity levels (around 40-50%) are ideal
Vegetative Growth (Late Fall to Early Spring)
•	Moderate Humidity: During the vegetative growth phase, moderate humidity (around 40-60%) is beneficial.
Corm Multiplication (Spring)
•	Moderate Humidity: In the spring, when the corms are multiplying, moderate humidity levels (around 40-60%) are optimal.
Light Intensity Required for Saffron:
Optimal Light Intensity: Full sunlight (6-8 hours per day) is generally required for most stages of saffron growth.
Partial Shade: Can be tolerated during germination if full sun is not available, but full sunlight is preferable.
Optimal PPFD: 400-700 µmol/m²/s depending on the growth stage.
Light Spectrum:
•	Blue Light (400-500 nm): Supports vegetative growth and chlorophyll production.
•	Red Light (600-700 nm): Essential for flowering and corm development.
•	Far-Red Light (700-800 nm): Enhances flowering timing and uniformity.
•	Green Light (500-600 nm): Minor role in deeper canopy photosynthesis.
SAFFRON PIGMENTS:
Crocin
•	Colour: Crocin is the primary pigment responsible for saffron's deep red to orange colour.
•	Absorption Spectrum: Crocin has a strong absorption peak in the blue region of the visible spectrum, typically around 440-470 nm.
•	Emission Spectrum: The emission of crocin typically occurs in the yellow to red range, around 500-700 nm, giving saffron its distinctive colour.
Picrocrocin
•	Color: Picrocrocin contributes to saffron's bitterness and has some influence on color but is less significant than crocin.
•	Absorption Spectrum: Picrocrocin absorbs light primarily in the UV region, with peaks around 250-350 nm.
•	Emission Spectrum: It emits in the UV to visible range, but its contribution to saffron's visible color is minimal compared to crocin.
Safranal
•	Color and Aroma: Safranal is mainly responsible for saffron's aroma rather than its color. It is a volatile compound that contributes to the overall sensory profile of saffron.
•	Absorption Spectrum: Safranal absorbs in the UV range, particularly around 270- 310 nm.
•	Emission Spectrum: Similar to picrocrocin, safranal's emission is primarily in the UV range and does not significantly contribute to the visible color of saffron
